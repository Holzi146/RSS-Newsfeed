RSS-Newsfeed
============

- Usage: - Run the app.js in your Node.js command prompt, which will automatically start the server (listens on port 1337).
	 - Go to your webbrowser and type in "localhost:1337".
	 - You can now enter the URL of a website that supports RSS-feeds. It then shows you the latest articles which you can click on.

- Important: node_modues.rar contains the used modules (such as express, jade, ...) which I had to zip, because for some reason GitHub
  	     would not allow me to upload this directory...

- This project uses the node-feedparser which you can find here: https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser
